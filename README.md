# import { Saulo as Developer } from 'profile'

Most of the time I'm working as a Fullstack Developer but I also tend to spent my nights trying to learn about game development.

Some of the personal projects I've worked on:

- [User Randomizer](https://github.com/saulo-m-oz/randomize-user) - Made with Vue - [GitPage](https://saulo-m-oz.github.io/randomize-user/)
- [Topdown RPG](https://github.com/saulo-m-oz/topdown_rpg) - Super basic 2D game made with Raylib to learn the basics of C++
